## Airspeed Limitations 

|     |SPEED|IAS  |REMARKS|
|-----|-----|----------|-------|
|Vne  |Never Exceed Speed|200 KTS|Do not exceed this speed in any operation.|
|Vno  |Maximum Structural Cruising Speed|167 KTS|Exceed this speed only in smooth air.|
|Va   |Maneuvering Speed|123 KTS|Do not make full control movements above this speed.  Full elevator deflection will result in a 6g load at this speed.|
|Vfe|Maximum Flap Extended Speed|96 KTS|Do not extend flaps above this speed.|
|Vfe-20|Maximum Flap Extended Speed|87 KTS|Do not extend more than 20 degrees of flaps above this speed.|
|Vy   |Best Rate of Climb|96 KTS||
|Vx   |Best Angle of Climb|70 KTS||
|Vs   |Stall Speed Clean|56 KTS||
|Vso  |Stall Speed Landing Configuration|50 KTS||
